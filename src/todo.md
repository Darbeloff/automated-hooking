# TODO

- combine controls and utils files (make python package?)
- OdriveClass gets amp-control mode, is placed in Util file
- figure out description publisher; make gantry_description and target_description xacros, import them into one system_description
- winch_node controls different winches in different modes
- make or modify odrive class so controlling all odrives is easier
